# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

  I'm Josh (also known as 'dubs' or 'duhby') and I'm a developer that is sometimes, admittedly, addicted to coding haha. I mainly code in Python but I also know some Java and JavaScript. My aesthetically pleasing and visually stunning website can be found <a href='https://dubs.rip'>here</a> and you can find my discord here: dubs#0001.
